* ## **Game**

    The nO<sub>2</sub> game! At every new game the player starts
    with one tree and their goal is to survive as long as possible.
    The CO<sub>2</sub> bar fills up constantly, and the rate at
    which it fills up grows over time. To combat this, the player
    needs to collect oxygen the trees produce every 5 seconds
    by clicking the icon that pops over them. To plant a new tree,
    click on an empty grass tile and pay the requested amount of
    oxygen. Planting new trees also raises the capacity of the
    oxygen bar, but it can only be raised up to 200. Clicking
    the oxygen bar will spend all of your collected oxygen and
    reduce the CO<sub>2</sub> value by half of what you spent.
    The temperature is dependent on CO<sub>2</sub> and vice
    versa. If the CO<sub>2</sub> value is high, the temperature will
    rise accordingly, or if it is low, lower. If the temperature
    is high, the CO<sub>2</sub> bar will fill up faster. If
    the temperature gets over 50 degrees, the grid will start
    flooding. You may reclaim land if you manage to bring the 
    temperature back below 32 degrees, but the original water
    tiles cannot be turned to land. When the whole grid is flooded,
    you lose. Your score depends on how many days you last
    (day increments every 2 seconds) time two, how much oxygen
    you collect (collecting oxygen from a tree grants 1 score
    point), how much oxygen you spend to reduce CO<sub>2</sub>
    (spending oxygen for this purpose grants you the exact amount
    of oxygen you spent as score), how many trees you plant
    (planting a tree grants 5 score), how many tiles were flooded
    (a tile flooding deducts 5 score) and how many tiles you
    reclaimed (reclaiming a tile grants 15 score).
